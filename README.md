# Porunga #R-Kali: Giving the KaliÂ´s dragon a name and a maiden flight. 

Aerial platform for Recon, Intelligence and Pentesting. 

#This is a project that I never documented.
#Starting now... Bring Kali into the Air !


Based on a Mavic Pro (DJI Drone) equipped with a Raspberry Pi 3, long-range wireless antennas,  payload mounts x3, and payload dropping capacity. 

Configuration are adaptable following the requirements of the task, the main functions of the Porunga are the following: 


- Imagery Intelligence / IMINT: 7Km Max range (5km operational) and max resolution 4K @60FPS 

- Geographical Intelligence / GEOINT: with the same principles and specs as above. 

- Signal Intelligence / SIGINT : With the Raspberry configurated on wardrving, using ubertooth and/or Wi-Fi antennas. 2x5Dbi antenna mountable as a payload. 

- Network recognition: the same configuration as above with a warberry configuration. 

- Penetration Testing: when landed on a surface with rotors off, the autonomy given by the drone is over 40 min per battery - In flight, the autonomy is limited to 18min with full payload capacity. 
the Raspberry is loaded with a Kali Linux ARM image. 

- Red Team Penetration testing: The Raspberry is equipped with a 4G Sim Card Shield, allowing the drone operator to focus on flight operation while the Red team can operate remotely the Kali Linux. 

- IMSI Catcher A.K.A Stingray device (Mass surveillance): Configuring the Raspberry as an IMSI catcher allows a portable fast and agile IMSI catcher. 

- IMSI Hunter (Counter-surveillance): As a payload a Samsung Galaxy S2 running the Nethunter OS (Kali mobile version) and a set of application (Stingwatch, SnoopSnitch...) allows to uncover rogue stingray devices set in the public domain.  
The S2 allows remote connection, it can be operated by a remote Red Team.
